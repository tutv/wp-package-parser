========================

A PHP library for parsing WordPress plugin and theme metadata. Point it at a ZIP package and it will:

- Tell you whether it contains a plugin or a theme.
- Give you the metadata from the comment header (Version, Description, Author URI, etc).
- Parse readme.txt into a list of headers and sections.
- Convert readme.txt contents from Markdown to HTML.

Installation
-----------

Include `wp-package-parser.php` or [install the composer package](https://packagist.org/packages/tutv95/wp-package-parser).
